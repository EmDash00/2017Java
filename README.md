# 2017Java

This is a fork of Team135BlackKnights 2017Java Repo, which was made by me on my time on the Penn Robotics Team for the FIRST Robotics Competition using [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib).
This was a port from C++ to Java of the 2017Code repository publicly available in Team135BlackKnights during the year we transitioned from C++ to Java.  
  
2017 was an instrumental year where we honed our signature west coast drive and developed a shooter robot unlike any game before. The motivation for this port  
was to ensure future generations of our team would have access to modern code in our new language for shooter-like robots.
